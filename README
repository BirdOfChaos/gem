Extended instructions:

Installing and running GEM
Environment and Climate Change Canada

* Installing GEM

To compile and run GEM, you will need:
- Fortran and C compilers,
- MPI/OpenMPI library (with development package),
- BLAS library (with development package),
- LAPACK library (with development package),
- fftw3 library (with development package),
- basic Unix utilities such as cmake (version 2.8.7 minimum), bash, sed, etc.

Install GEM:
- Clone or download the git tar file of GEM at GitLab: http://gitlab.com/gem-ec/goas
- cd goas
- Execute the script named download-dbase.sh or download directly the
  datafile at the following address, and untar it:
  http://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/science/outgoing/goas/gem_dbase.tar.gz

#gfortran and gcc compilers
- GEM is already configured by default to use gfortran and gcc compilers
- make sure the compilers and libraries are in the appropriate
  PATHS: you may have to initialize ${PATH} and ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}.
  Examples (to be changed according to your setup):
  . On Ubuntu:
    export PATH=/usr/lib/openmpi/bin:${PATH}
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/openmpi/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  . On Fedora:
    export PATH=/usr/lib64/openmpi/bin:$PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib64/openmpi/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

#INTEL COMPILER
- by default, a configuration for Intel 19 is used.
  You can use a configuration for Intel 16 by changing the symbolic link:
  - cd goas/sources
  - rm Linux-x86_64-intel.cmake
  - ln -s Linux-x86_64-intel.cmake.16 Linux-x86_64-intel.cmake
- changes to the C and Fortran flags can be done in the Linux-x86_64-intel.cmake
- make sure the compilers and libraries are in the appropriate
  PATHS: you may have to initialize ${PATH} and ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}.

#PGI compiler
- by default, a configuration for PGI 17.10 is used.
  You can use a configuration for PGI 18 by changing the symbolic link:
  - cd goas/sources
  - rm Linux-x86_64-pgi.cmake
  - ln -s Linux-x86_64-pgi.cmake_18.4 Linux-x86_64-pgi.cmake
- make sure the compilers and libraries are in the appropriate
  PATHS: you may have to initialize ${PATH} and ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}.
  Examples for PGI (to be changed according to your setup):
  export PGI=/local/CUDA/PGI/pgi
  export LM_LICENSE_FILE=$PGI/license.dat
  export PATH=$PGI/bin:$PGI/mpi/openmpi/bin:PATH
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PGI/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

* Compiling and installing GEM
- cd goas/sources
- gcc and gfortran compilers are set by default
- if you want to compile with other compilers, modify the file
  goas/sources/CmakeLists.txt by uncommenting one of the lines 
  to use the compiler desired:
  (for example: set(COMPILER intel CACHE INTERNAL compiler)
- mkdir -p build
- cd build
- cmake ..

- if you get error messages (for example, compiler or MPI/OpenMPI not
  found), make sure these tools are exported in their respective PATHS (see
  above)

- if compiler or compile options are not right:
  . remove the content of the build directory
  . make appropriate changes to the cmake file named according to the
    Fortran compiler you are using, in the sources directory:
    Linux-x86_64-gfortran.cmake if you compile with gfortran or
    Linux-x86_64-intel.cmake if you compile with Intel
  . cmake ..

- make -j
- make install

- a directory named after the operating system you compiled on, and the
  compiler you used (work-OS_NAME-COMPILER_NAME: for example
  work-Fedora-29-x86_64-gfortran-8.2.1) is created in the work directory of
  GEM on a stick, and the following binaries are installed in a bin
  directory in it: maingemdm, maingemgrid, mainyy2global, flipit, r.fstinfo,
  voir, editfst, fststat, cclargs_lite, pgsm

* Running GEM

- Move to the working directory, named work-[OS-NAME_COMPILER-NAME], for
  example work-Linux_x86-64-gfortran-8.2.1:
  cd goas/work-[OS-NAME_COMPILER-NAME]
- ./runprep (will create a directory named PREP)
- ./runmod (will run the model and create a directory named
  RUNMOD.dir with output files)
  or use ./runmod -ptopo 2x2x1 (to use 4 cpus for GEM-LAM,
  8 cpus for GEM-Yin-Yang - see manual for details)

- default configuration for runprep and runmod is GEM_cfgs/cfg_0000

- default setup uses the command "mpirun" to run the model.  This command
  can be modified in the file scripts/Um_model.sh, line 34, either in the
  original sources of the scripts (sources/orig-scripts/scripts) or in the
  working directory (work/work-[OS_NAME-COMPILER_NAME]/scripts). In the
  latter case, be advised that any changes to the scripts will be erased at
  the next "make install" step. So, if you want your changes to the scripts
  to be permanent, make them in the sources/orig-scripts/scripts directory,
  and then rerun the command make install in the sources/build directory.
 
* Tools to inspect the outputs
- Use voir to see what records are produced in the FST output files:
./voir -iment RUNMOD.dir/output/cfg0000/laststep0000000024/000-000/dm2009042700-000-000010

- Use fststat to look at statistical means on the records:
./fststat -fst RUNMOD.dir/output/cfg0000/laststep0000000024/000-000/dm2009042700-000-000010

- pgsm is a program to interpolate records to a different grid
./pgsm -iment <input FST> -ozsrt <output FST> -i <pgsm.directives>

- editfst is a program to manipulate records into another file
./editfst -s <input FST> -d <output FST> -i <editfst.directives>

You can also install SPI, a scientific and meteorological virtual globe
offering processing, analysis and visualization capabilities, with a user
interface similar to Google Earth and NASA World Wind, developed by
Environment Canada.  SPI can be downloaded at
http://eer.cmc.ec.gc.ca/software/SPI
Follow instructions found in INSTALL.txt, in the 7.12.0 directory.

You can also install xrec, a visualisation program used to display 2D
meteorological fields stored in the RPN standard file format, developed by
Research Informatics Services, Meteorological Research Division, Environment
and Climate Change Canada. xrec on a stick can be cloned or downloaded at:
https://gitlab.com/gem-ec/xoas

Please see the manual for more details.
